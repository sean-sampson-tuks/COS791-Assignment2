#### Requirements to run this file  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  

#### Python libraries used  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Utilized for various image processing tasks such as Gaussian blur, Hough Transform, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection.  
- **NumPy**: Used for mathematical computations and handling arrays.  
- **Pandas (pd)**: Used for handling data frames and CSV files to process and store the results.  
- **scikit-image (ssim, psnr)**: Used for calculating image quality metrics, including the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).  
- **os**: Handles file path and directory management in the project.  
- **Matplotlib (plt)**: Used for visualizing image results and displaying graphs of the segmentation performance.  

#### Commands to install each library  
- `pip install opencv-python`  
- `pip install numpy`  
- `pip install pandas`  
- `pip install scikit-image`  
- `pip install matplotlib`  

**Once Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the relevant libraries are installed, please proceed to the next step:**  

#### Command to run the project  
- Open the `u24101754-ass2.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.  
- The results should already be displayed in Jupyter Notebook.  
    - If results are not visible, click the "Run All" cells button to generate and view the results.  

#### Folder Structure  
- `u24101754_Ass2`  
    - `Ass2` (folder with images)  
    - `u24101754-ass2.ipynb`  
    - `README.md`  
    - `u24101754_Ass2_Report.pdf`  
    - `processed_results.csv`
