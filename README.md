## Assignment 2
### Sean Sampson (u24101754)

#### Requirements to run this file 
- python
- jupyter notebook

#### Python libraries used
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: This library is utlised for image processing tasks used in this project such as Gaussian blur, Hough Transform, Sobel as well as the standard Canny Edge Detection.
- **NumPy**: This is used for mathematical calculations.
- **scikit-image (ssim)**: This library is for calculating the structural similarity index (SSIM) which compares the image quality.
- **os**: This would handle accessing of file paths and directories.

#### Command to run to install each library
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install numpy
- pip install scikit-image

**Once python, jupyter notebook and relevant libraries are installed please proceed to the next step:**

#### Command to run project
